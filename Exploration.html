      <h1>What are Exploratory Robots?</h1>
      <p>Exploratory Robots that are designed and used spefically to explore undiscovered places, or places that humans cannot get to or are just too dangerous for humans, such as the deep sea or mars. These robots are equipped with tools like cameras, claws, shovels, small drills etc... These tools are then used to gather information of these undiscovered places that help us understand these mysterious areas. The most famous of these machines are the mars rovers, one that has been active since 2011 is Curiosity. </p>
